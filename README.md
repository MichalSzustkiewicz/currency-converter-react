# *Currency converter*

## Demo

https://michalszustkiewicz.github.io/currency-converter-react/

## Description

This simple application has been created as a part of the project carried out at [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/) programming school. You may use it e.g. to check how much money you will get if you want to exchange from polish "zloty" (PLN) to some other common currencies. Returned values are based on data obtained from the Polish National Bank on 20.12.2022.

In order to use the application, please type in the first field ("Kwota w PLN*) the amount of money in PLN. Then choose one from seven available currencies in the second field ("Waluta"). To receive the result click "Przelicz!" (demonstration below).

## Languages and technologies

- HTML
- CSS (BEM, Flex Box)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Create React App (webpack, Babel)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
